Hi! This is my attempt to study how returns depend on wheather a close was all-time high or not.
So in these notebook we will find indexes of months that are ath closed and ones that are not.
We will define a 2 functions of perioud after close, that output average cont. comp. int. rate on this period.
One of them is for anth closed month and one if for not ath closed ones.
Then we'll plot their outputs for for periods up to 120 months.

Please note: the following code is not of the best quality and so is this research.
You should only belieave the conclusion if you have checked everything.

Feel free to contact me.
